### OOP assessment Questions. 


## Question 1: Class and Object Creation:
Write a Python class named Car with attributes for make, model, and year. Add a method called display_info() that prints out the car’s details. Create an instance of the Car class and call the display_info() method.

## Question 2: Encapsulation:
Create a class named BankAccount with a private attribute balance. Add methods deposit() and withdraw() to adjust the balance, ensuring balance can’t be directly accessed or modified outside the class. Write code to demonstrate depositing and withdrawing money while maintaining encapsulation.

## Question 3: Inheritance:
Create a base class Animal with methods like eat() and sleep(). Then create a subclass Dog that inherits from Animal and adds a method bark(). Show how you can use both the inherited methods and the new method in an instance of Dog.

## Question 4: Polymorphism:
Define two classes, Cat and Dog, each with a make_sound() method that prints a different sound specific to each animal. Write a function that takes an object and calls make_sound(), then demonstrate polymorphism by passing instances of both Cat and Dog to this function.

## Question 5: Constructor Overloading:
Python does not directly support constructor overloading, but you can simulate it using default arguments. Write a class Rectangle with a constructor that can initialize the rectangle with either one (for a square) or two parameters (for a general rectangle). Add a method to calculate the area, and test it by creating squares and rectangles.

## Question 6: Method Overriding:
Create a base class Employee with a method calculate_salary() that prints a generic message. Then create a subclass Manager that overrides calculate_salary() to provide a specific calculation for a manager’s salary. Demonstrate the overridden behavior.

## Question 7: Composition:
Define two classes, Engine and Car. The Car class should have an attribute engine that is an instance of the Engine class. Write methods for Engine (e.g., start() and stop()) and show how the Car class can use these methods to control the engine.

## Question 8: Static Methods and Attributes:
Write a Calculator class with a static method add() that takes two numbers and returns their sum. Also, add a static attribute count to track the number of times the add() method has been called. Show how to use this static method and update count.

## Question 9: Operator Overloading:
Define a class Vector that represents a vector in 2D space with x and y components. Overload the + operator to allow vector addition. Test this functionality by creating two Vector objects and adding them.

## Question 10: Abstract Classes:
Use the abc module to create an abstract base class Shape with an abstract method area(). Then, implement subclasses Circle and Square that provide their own implementations of area(). Write code to create instances of Circle and Square, and call area() on each.

## Question 11
How can we utilize the objects created from the class blueprint
employee , to get the company's total payroll in class Payroll ?
